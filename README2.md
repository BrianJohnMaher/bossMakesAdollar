# Employee Tracker CMS

## Description

This assignment tasked us to build a command-line application from scratch. 
This app is used to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The app allows an end-user, to keep track of an entire employee database-network. Users will have the ability to easily view all departments, roles and employees within their system.
Additionally, users are able to update an employee's role, as well as assign employee managers to a group of employees.
